MODULE  FUNCTION
time -> ctime()
      Named after: "current time"
      This function converts current time expressed in seconds to a string representing local time.
      If an argument isn't provided, ctime will just use the current time in seconds and return
      the current time string.
      If an argument is provided (an int representing the seconds), it is transformed to a string
      representing the time according to the argument provided.
      IMPORTANT: Locale information is not used by ctime().

      - SYNTAX -
	time.ctime([secs])

      - paramenters -
	secs -- OPTIONAL PARAMETER - (If provided) This is the number of seconds the function uses
		in order to transform it to a string representing the current time.

      sleep()
      Named after: "sleep"
      This function suspends execution for a determined (by the programmer) number of seconds.
      The argument may be a floating point number in order to indicate a more precise sleep time, or
      an integer to represent seconds.

	time.sleep(time)

      - parameters -
	time -- REQUIRED PARAMETER - This is the number of seconds the execution to be suspended.
