FUNCTIONS FROM CLASSES:

class time -> ctime()
              Named after: "current time"
	      This function converts current time expressed in seconds to a string representing local time.
	      If an argument isn't provided, ctime will just use the current time in seconds and return
	      the current time string.
	      If an argument is provided (an int representing the seconds), it is transformed to a string
	      representing the time according to the argument provided.
	      IMPORTANT: Locale information is not used by ctime().
